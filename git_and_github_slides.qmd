## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Why use Git?

1.  *Recover earlier versions of your work.* Make a mistake? Go down the wrong rabbit hole? No worries, you can undo those changes.
2.  *Revisit the complete history of all changes.* You can go back to previous versions of your project to see where it was at weeks, months, years ago.
3.  *Keep a record of why changes were made.* Git provides an opportunity to document every change with **commit messages**, which can be viewed later.
4.  *Experiment without changing the main project.* Git allows you to create **branches** that are separate from the main project, which can be merged if they work, and discarded if they don't.
